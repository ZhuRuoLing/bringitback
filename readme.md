# BringItBack

We see that mojang removed many features from Minecraft.  
Now we decided to bring some of them back.

## Features  

What mojang [changes](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-1-19-1-release-candidate-1) in 1.19.1-rc1:
> - The `run_command` click event for text components no longer supports sending chat messages directly  
>  - Only commands are supported, so a command such as `/say` should be used instead  
>  - This means values now always need to be ‘/’-prefixed  

BringItBack make run_command click event send chat messages directly in versions 1.19.1 and higher.
